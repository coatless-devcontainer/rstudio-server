# RStudio Server Devcontainer

This repository houses a devcontainer example that contains R & RStudio. The container is setup to work with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to instantly have a cloud-based developer workflow that makes use of RStudio Server for a familiar R data science environment.

You can try out the Codespace by clicking on the following button:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/coatless-devcontainer/rstudio-server?quickstart=1)

**Note:** Codespaces are available to Students and Teachers for free [up to 180 core hours per month](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/using-github-codespaces-with-github-classroom#about-github-codespaces) through [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/). Otherwise, you will have [up to 60 core hours and 15 GB free per month](https://github.com/features/codespaces#pricing).

After clicking the link, the codespace will need some time to set itself up. You can either hang tight or grab a coffee.

After the codespace is setup, you will need to navigate to the `Ports` Tab in the lower section of VS Code. Next, hover over the `Local Address` area. Select the `Globe` icon that appears in the popup menu to be taken into RStudio Server instance.
